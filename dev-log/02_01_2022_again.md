### Overview
In the past release, I encontured that a single discord message from the bot cannot contain more than 2000 characters. For the immediate solution, I decided to decrement the number of advertisement to 8. Now it was time to implement the permanent solution to the issue.


### Changelog

#### show advertisements on seperate messages to avoid character limit on discord

To implement the solution, i decided to break down the advertisement message into seperate compontents and send message one by one. I decided to slice down the advertisements into two parts of 8 advertisements in each part (which is roughly 1500 chars per part) and send help + heading message as a seperate component.

With this implementation, we now can show the users as many advertisements as we want to.
