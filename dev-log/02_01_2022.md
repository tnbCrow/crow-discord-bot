### Overview
We request for the features from the community and one of the community members suggested to add rating/ merchant info on the crow bot. Once the MVP of the merchant stats is pushed, we then decided to push the rating system into the crow bot. The users will now be able to give feedback to each other once the escrow is released.


### Changelog

#### Implement feedback mechanism

Introduce the three buttons that lets traders review eachother. The reviews are `GOOD`, `BAD` and `NEUTRAL` each represented by emoji.

Once someone uses the emoji, use the unique id of that emoji button `escrowreview_{escrow_obj.uuid_hex}_GOOD` to track each reviews. We're using EscrowReview table to track the reviews create by the traders. If someone has reviewed the escrow already, we'll be updating their existing review to the latest one. If not, we'll create an entry on the escrow review table and update the Profile of user with the new feedback.
